# Checklist Tool MVP
_only used as a demonstrator, not in active development_

A barebone (MVP) Streamlit app that renders a checklist interface from JSON files based on the VDE Spec 90012. Designed for fast iteration: JSON files define questions, options, and metadata; the app renders them as interactive checklists and saves responses locally and allows to download them as JSON.
